            <h3>Hey there!</h3>
            <p>Curiosity is one of the essentials that make us humans. It is not only what drove our evolution as a species throughout history but is also what pushes us to learn more and grow as individuals every day.</p>

            <h2>Thank you for being curious!</h2>
            <p>Building a career in STEM is not always easy. You need to work hard and have a lot of patience and trust that one day you will achieve your aims. Yet, we all can agree that however difficult, following your passion (be it in the field of STEM or not) is always fun - it is exciting and challenging and gives us the feeling of “I am burning for this, therefore I must be on the right track.” Trust me when I say I feel the same way as you do - holding onto my dream real tight, trying to be good at what I do when I am certain there is a large amount of information and skills I need to acquire to be at least 5% closer to my end goal. It is a long journey full of ups and downs. But hey, you do not need to go through it alone. The STEM community is growing more and more all around the world, and this mini blog of mine is my way of giving back, as well as helping inspire more young people to pursue their dreams no matter how high the aim is because guess what - the sky is just the starting point and there is no limit.</p>
